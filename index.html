                <p class="content">A Wolf resolved to disguise himself in order that he might prey upon a flock of
                    sheep without fear of detection. So he clothed himself in a sheepskin, and slipped among the sheep
                    when they were out at pasture. He completely deceived the shepherd, and when the flock was penned
                    for the night he was shut in with the rest. But that very night as it happened, the shepherd,
                    requiring a supply of mutton for the table, laid hands on the Wolf in mistake for a Sheep, and
                    killed him with his knife on the spot.</p>

                <h1 class="title">THE EAGLE, THE CAT, AND THE WILD SOW</h1>
                <p class="content">An Eagle built her nest at the top of a high tree; a Cat with her family occupied a
                    hollow in the trunk half-way down; and a Wild Sow and her young took up their quarters at the foot.
                    They might have got on very well as neighbours had it not been for the evil cunning of the Cat.
                    Climbing up to the Eagle's nest she said to the Eagle, "You and I are in the greatest possible
                    danger. That dreadful creature, the Sow, who is always to be seen grubbing away at the foot of the
                    tree, means to uproot it, that she may devour your family and mine at her ease." Having thus driven
                    the Eagle almost out of her senses with terror, the Cat climbed down the tree, and said to the Sow,
                    "I must warn you against that dreadful bird, the Eagle. She is only waiting her chance to fly down
                    and carry off one of your little pigs when you take them out, to feed her brood with." She
                    succeeded in frightening the Sow as much as the Eagle. Then she returned to her hole in the trunk,
                    from which, feigning to be afraid, she never came forth by day. Only by night did she creep out
                    unseen to procure food for her kittens. The Eagle, meanwhile was afraid to stir from her nest, and
                    the Sow dared not leave her home among the roots: so that in time both they and their families
                    perished of hunger, and their dead bodies supplied the Cat with ample food for her growing family.</p>

                <h1 class="title">THE TOWN MOUSE AND THE COUNTRY MOUSE</h1>
                <p class="content">A Town Mouse and a Country Mouse were acquaintances, and the Country Mouse one day
                    invited his friend to come and see him at his home in the fields. The Town Mouse came, and they sat
                    down to a dinner of barleycorns and roots, the latter of which had a distinctly earthy flavour. The
                    fare was not much to the taste of the guest, and presently he broke out with "My poor dear friend,
                    you live here no better than the ants. Now, you should just see how I fare! My larder is a regular
                    horn of plenty. You must come and stay with me, and I promise you you shall live on the fat of the
                    land." So when he returned to town he took the Country Mouse with him, and showed him into a larder
                    containing flour and oatmeal and figs and honey and dates. The Country Mouse had never seen
                    anything like it, and sat down to enjoy the luxuries his friend provided: but before they had well
                    begun, the door of the larder opened and some one came in. The two Mice scampered off and hid
                    themselves in a narrow and exceedingly uncomfortable hole. Presently, when all was quiet, they
                    ventured out again; but some one else came in, and off they scuttled again. This was too much for
                    the visitor. "Good-bye," said he, "I'm off. You live in the lap of luxury, I can see, but you are
                    surrounded by dangers; whereas at home I can enjoy my simple dinner of roots and corn in peace."</p>

                <p class="content">One fine day in winter some Ants were busy drying their store of corn, which had got
                    rather damp during a long spell of rain. Presently up came a Grasshopper and begged them to spare
                    her a few grains, "For," she said, "I'm simply starving." The Ants stopped work for a moment,
                    though this was against their principles. "May we ask," said they, "what you were doing with
                    yourself all last summer? Why didn't you collect a store of food for the winter?" "The fact is,"
                    replied the Grasshopper, "I was so busy singing that I hadn't the time." "If you spent the summer
                    singing," replied the Ants, "you can't do better than spend the winter dancing." And they chuckled
                    and went on with their work.</p>

                <p class="content">An Archer went up into the hills to get some sport with his bow, and all the animals
                    fled at the sight of him with the exception of the Lion, who stayed behind and challenged him to
                    fight. But he shot an arrow at the Lion and hit him, and said, "There, you see what my messenger
                    can do: just you wait a moment and I'll tackle you myself." The Lion, however, when he felt the
                    sting of the arrow, ran away as fast as his legs could carry him. A fox, who had seen it all
                    happen, said to the Lion, "Come, don't be a coward: why don't you stay and show fight?" But the
                    Lion replied, "You won't get me to stay, not you: why, when he sends a messenger like that before
                    him, he must himself be a terrible fellow to deal with."
